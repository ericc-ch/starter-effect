### Task Completed: CORS Middleware

**What was done:**
- Created `apps/api/src/lib/http/cors.ts` with CORS middleware using `@effect/platform`
- Configured allowed origins, credentials, methods, and headers per plan.md specification

**Decisions made:**
- Used `HttpMiddleware.cors` from `@effect/platform` as recommended in plan.md
- Kept the configuration simple and focused on the essential CORS settings

**Blockers encountered:**
- None for this specific task

**Files changed:**
- Created: `apps/api/src/lib/http/cors.ts`
- Modified: `plan.md` (marked CORS Middleware as complete)

**Pre-existing issues noted:**
- Typecheck shows many errors in legacy Hono/oRPC code (expected during migration)
- Tests fail due to missing procedure files (organization-members, organizations, users)
- Lint error in `effect-test.ts` (unrelated to this task)
