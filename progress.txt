### Task Completed: CORS Middleware

**What was done:**
- Created `apps/api/src/lib/http/cors.ts` with CORS middleware using `@effect/platform`
- Configured allowed origins, credentials, methods, and headers per plan.md specification

**Decisions made:**
- Used `HttpMiddleware.cors` from `@effect/platform` as recommended in plan.md
- Kept the configuration simple and focused on the essential CORS settings

**Blockers encountered:**
- None for this specific task

**Files changed:**
- Created: `apps/api/src/lib/http/cors.ts`
- Modified: `plan.md` (marked CORS Middleware as complete)

**Pre-existing issues noted:**
- Typecheck shows many errors in legacy Hono/oRPC code (expected during migration)
- Tests fail due to missing procedure files (organization-members, organizations, users)
- Lint error in `effect-test.ts` (unrelated to this task)

## Session 2026-02-01

### Task Completed: Auth Session Middleware

**What was done:**
- Created `apps/api/src/lib/auth/session.ts` with session extraction and auth middleware
- Implemented `CurrentUser` Context.Tag for dependency injection
- Created `SessionSchema` using Effect Schema for type-safe session validation
- Implemented `extractSession` effect to read Cookie header and call Better Auth's `getSession`
- Implemented `requireAuth` and `optionalAuth` helpers for different auth requirements
- Created `CurrentUserLive` and `CurrentUserOptionalLive` layers for providing user context
- Exported `UnauthorizedError` tagged error for auth failures

**Decisions made:**
- Used `Option<Session>` pattern for optional auth scenarios instead of throwing
- Converted Effect's custom Headers type to Web API Headers using Object.entries()
- Made CurrentUser service provide user info directly (not the full session) for convenience
- Created separate layers for required vs optional auth to support different use cases

**Blockers encountered:**
- Had to research Effect's Headers type structure (it's a custom object, not Web API Headers)
- Better Auth's `getSession` expects Web API Headers, so conversion was needed

**Files changed:**
- Created: `apps/api/src/lib/auth/session.ts`
- Modified: `plan.md` (marked Auth Session Middleware as complete)

**Pre-existing issues noted:**
- Typecheck shows many errors in legacy Hono/oRPC code (expected during migration)
- Tests fail due to missing procedure files (organization-members, organizations, users)
- Lint error in `effect-test.ts` (unrelated to this task)
