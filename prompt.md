0. Read plan.md and progress.txt to understand the state of the project.
1. Find the highest-priority task to work on (not necessarily first in list).
2. Work ONLY on that single task until complete.
3. After completing a task, reread the whole file and review.
4. Run type checks, tests, and lint (if available). During major refactoring, these may be broken until the final task is complete.
5. Update plan.md to check off completed items with [x].
6. Append to progress.txt:
   - Tasks completed in this session
   - Decisions made and why
   - Blockers encountered
   - Files changed
7. Update AGENTS.md if fundamental changes were made to the codebase
8. Make a git commit for that task.
   ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK. YOU ARE DONE AFTER THAT SINGLE TASK IS COMPLETE.
   If plan.md is fully complete (all items checked), ensure type checks, tests, and lint all pass, then output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>.
